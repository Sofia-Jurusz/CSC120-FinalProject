design justification:

This game's driving force is the user's interactions with different characters. Some player-person interactions were simple, and in that case, the conversations between the player and those People were relatively simple and the same. However, I wanted some of the Person interactions to be more complex and engaging. Therefore, I decided to make separate classes for the more important People: Delphine(wiseLady), Shark, and the Queen. I made the complexPerson class so that the Player and wiseLady classes could share some of their methods. Initially, I created one conversation method and tried to have every character operate under the same one. This, however, limited my ability for unique interactions. Since I am new to a lot of these concepts, I am sure there was a more straightforward way for me to implement these ideas. However, it made sense to do it this way at the time since I wanted the user to be on their toes. 

**overall approach**
To tackle this project, I started by outlining all the simple classes, Person, Place, and Thing, and filling them with basic methods. I knew I wanted some of the methods in the game, but others were just for testing. Then, once I had a general outline of the Thing, Person, Place, and Player classes, I started making the whole game loop. I knew that the game's interactive elements would be the most challenging part for me, so I wanted to get started on it early. This way, I wouldn't need to change my methods to be interactive. This was a good approach for me because going back to change things takes more time than it's worth. I slowly added more options so the player could swim, explore, and talk to people.

**new thing(s)**
There are many CS skills Iâ€™ve improved on throughout this project and the course as a whole. First,  I am much more comfortable with user inputs and scanners. Using the scanners was difficult for me during the chatbot, but in the final project, I better understood how to use them by passing them through different methods. Second, I originally had a class called 'map', an ArrayList of ArrayLists containing the locations in my game. This was a little unnecessary and confusing, so I implemented 'neighbors' as an attribute for a Place. 'Neighbors' is a hash table that stores a place's neighbors and the direction you need to move to get to them. After implementing the map class, I became more comfortable with ArrayLists, and, during the switch, I learned to be careful with my code when making changes. The most important skill I learned was being able to plan ahead and think abstractly about how my classes would work together. I still want to improve on using arrays and ArrayLists. Most importantly, I learned how to make many different complex elements work together. I have a much better understanding of how to get classes to work together.

**implemented differently**
If I could change something, I would improve the conversation classes. Right now, I have six conversation classes because the interactions between the player and different characters are different. If I could go back, I would think about how I could write one or two conversation classes that allow for unique interactions.

**unlimited time**
If I had unlimited time, I would add more challenges for the player to get to the end. For example, there is a Place called Shipwreck that does not have any real purpose. Initially, I wanted the player to find something in the shipwreck, but I ran out of time to implement this. I was also struggling creatively with what the next challenge would be, maybe a riddle. Second, there is a point in the game where the player needs to get through the shark. The only way to do it is to use a Krabby Patty (and not the sword). I was thinking about making the second Krabby Patty something that the user has to go back to the Krusty Krab and get themselves. Lastly, I want to keep track of the number of moves a person makes while playing the game (swimming, talking, etc) and create a scoreboard. 

**piece of feedback**
I got two really good pieces of feedback. The first was from Jazmine in my class. In her game, every command had a list of words a user could input to get the same command. For example, users can type 'go' or 'walk' to move to a new location. She said she thought this could be helpful for me. Instead of for directions, I used this strategy for my Person names to make it easier for the user to interact with them. For example, a player could type talk to jellyfish, jelly, or jack to talk to the same character. Second, Jordan told me to do a hashtable of neighbors for each location instead of the map class. This cleaned up my code and made it much easier to understand from an outsider's perspective.

**advice**
If I could go back in time, I would tell myself not to stress too much. It was really fun making my game. I actually really like computer science. More practically, I would tell myself to use the hashtable for neighbors instead of the map because I would save a lot of time, and maybe implement some of the other parts I didn't get to.
