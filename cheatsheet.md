This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

# SPOILER ALERT: map layout
the file 'GameMap.png' contains the game map. Blue pathways are always accessible to a player, as long as they are in the corresponding location. Pink pathways are opened one at a time, once a player completes a certain challenge. 

# SPOILER ALERT: Challenges
1. First, you need to talk to delphine and retreive her errands (krabby patties and oyseters). Once this is complete, she will give you one krabby patty, a sword, and an amulet. she opens up her passage to the east.

2. Next, you need to retreive Jörmungandr from mer-maya. You are able to get Jörmungandr at any point in the game, even before you finish Delphine's challange. But you may not realize you need him until after completing Delphine's challenge, where she tells you the cave is dark. If you do not have him, you won't be able to move in the cave. 

3. Next, you will find the shark guarding the cave. When you talk to him, you can either use the krabby patty or the sword. However, if you use the sword he won't actually let you past. Instead, you must give him the krabby patty.

4. Finally, you must decide if you will return Aqua Pearl to the castle or let her free; this final decision determines whether you win the game or not.
